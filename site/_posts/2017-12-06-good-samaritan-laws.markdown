In West Virginia law, immunity protection exists for volunteers, duly qualified emergency service workers (paid or unpaid) and good Samaritans. Various degrees of protection are provided, but most
individuals acting in good faith, trying to help, are protected from liability for personal or property damage. Neither federal nor state legislation provide protection for acts that constitute “willful misconduct”.
